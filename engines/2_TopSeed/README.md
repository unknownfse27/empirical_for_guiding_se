# TopSeed
Topseed is a novel technique designed to enhance symbolic execution by selecting the most promising seeds without prior knowledge using a learning-based approach. Our paper is available in this repository, [TopSeed.pdf](https://github.com/skkusal/TopSeed/blob/main/accepted_paper_ICSE2025_TopSeed.pdf).

# Installation
We would like to introduce a Docker image for fast and easy installation. You can install TopSeed by following these instructions. (We also provided a direct [dockerfile](https://github.com/skkusal/TopSeed/blob/main/Dockerfile) for your convenience.)

```bash
$ docker pull skkusal/topseed:v2
$ docker run --rm -it --ulimit='stack=-1:-1' skkusal/topseed:v2
```

# Requirement
As we explained in section 'Installation', we provided a docker image with all requirements at [skkusal/topseed](https://hub.docker.com/r/skkusal/topseed). So, you can run TopSeed with the [docker](https://www.docker.com/) image on your device.

Our experiments were conducted on a single Linux machine powered by two Intel Xeon Gold 6230R processors with 256GB RAM. Therefore, the experimental results may differ depending on your own machine. More detailed information about the experimental environment is as follows:
* Ubuntu version: 18.04
* LLVM version: 6.0
* Python version: 3.8
* STP version: 2.3.3
* KLEE version: 2.1

# How to execute our approach
## Benchmarks
Our docker image included 17 open-source C programs that were used for the evaluation in our paper. All benchmarks are installed in '/root/topseed/benchmarks', and described in '/root/topseed/program_configs' as well.
```bash
$ ls /root/topseed/program_configs
'[.json'   combine.json   csplit.json   dd.json   diffutils.json   expr.json   factor.json   gawk.json   ginstall.json   grep.json
ln.json   od.json   patch.json   pr.json   sqlite.json   tr.json   trueprint.json
```

## Running TopSeed
To execute TopSeed, you can run the experiment using the following command in the '~/topseed' directory.
```bash
$ python3 topseed.py program_configs/diffutils.json 3600 1 --eta_time=120
```
Each argument of the command indicates:
* program_configs/diffutils.json : Description of the benchmark for testing the program
* 3600 : The total testing budget(sec)
* 1 : The prefix number of the experiment (the directory will be created as 'topseed/experiments_exp_{benchmark}/#1experiment')
* --eta_time=120 : The small time budget (hyperparameter $\eta_{time}$ in Algorithm 3)

If you want to conduct experiments with BASE (without our seeding approach), you can run the following commands.
```bash
$ python3 base.py program_configs/diffutils.json 3600 2 --eta_time=120
```

After executing the experiments, the results will be stored in 'topseed/experiments_exp_{benchmark}/#{1}experiment/' with the file names of '{benchmark}\_{1}\_result.coverage' and '{benchmark}\_{1}\_result.err.log'.

Additionally, if you want to assess the test cases generated during each iteration, you can access all generated data with following path:
* './topseed/experiments_exp_{benchmark}/#{2}experiment/iteration_\*/klee-out-0/\*.ktest' files


# Check the results of experiments
To evaluate branch coverage and bugs from the experiment results, you can easily analyze all outputs using the following command. The numbers {1} and {2} represent the experiment indexes mentioned in the 'Running TopSeed' section. This allows you to conveniently compare the performance improvements of TopSeed (index : {1}) against to the base KLEE (index : {2}). 
```bash
$ python3 analysis.py diff
# Set the iteration numbers of data : {1} {2}
                                            Coverage
The coverage results of #{1}experiment:      1258.0
The coverage results of #{2}experiment:      924.0        
```

# Status
We are applying for the three badges: Available, Reusalbe, and Functional badges.
- The DOI link is as: [https://zenodo.org/records/14890193](https://zenodo.org/records/14890193). Our artifact is available on the public repository at https://github.com/skkusal/topseed.
- We have provided all 17 benchmark programs used in the evaluation and helpful scripts for guiding the reproducement of the main experimental results of paper.
- We also have included the devcontainer settings with all requirements pre-installed. It allows other researchers easily to implement their own idea based on our tool in their research.
